## 1) The first task, SIFT Feature Extraction went well, with SIFT being able to detect lines well despite diffrent colors.

## 2) The second task, SURF did not go well, I had problems with needing OpenCV. I had to ask for help for my classmates, and after running their same code multiple times, It could not install properly and thus I had to skip this one.
### Despite multiple attempts, Open CV could not install properly thus I was not able to complete the SURF Task.

## 3) ORB went well, similar results to SIFT.
## 4) Feature Matching using SIFT was interesting, it was comparing and detecting specific details.
## 5) Image Stitching using Homography did not display due to not enough matches.
## 6) SURF and ORB could not be completed due to SURF needing OpenCV.
